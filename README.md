# What is this?

**Ruby Writes FizzBuzz** is intended to be a collaborative effort by the Ruby
community‒here meaning [/r/ruby](https://reddit.com/r/ruby) and
[#ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/community/)‒to write a working FizzBuzz
one character at a time. It's like [Twitch Installs Arch
Linux](http://twitchintheshell.com/) but with pull requests.

# How do I play?

Pull requests to this repository are *automatically merged* if and only if they
contain a single commit which makes a single-character modification to
`fizzbuzz.rb`. The introduction of a newline does not count towards this cap.
Successive PRs from the same contributor are considered invalid, and all
invalid PRs are automatically closed.
